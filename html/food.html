    <h1>Filet With Roasted Potatoes</h1>
    <h3>Easily My Favorite Meal</h3>
    
    <p>Steak has always been a favorite of mine, and as I have grown up I have enjoyed experimenting with different cuts and different ways of preparing them. Steak cuts in order of my preference are Filet, Ribeye, NY Strip, and Chuck.</p>
