    <h1>Django Unchained</h1>
    <h3>My Favorite Movie</h3>
    
    <p>Django is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece, I think that the multiple parallel storylines help to keep watchers engaged. I also like how it is a love and revenge story at the same time. Additionally, Dr. Schulz taking Django under his wing gives it a feel good element.</p>\
